Title: Customer Segmentation Through Fuzzy C-Means and Fuzzy RFM Method

Publication: Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, Vol. 78, No. 3 (2015).

Summary:

- Combines Fuzzy C-Means with a fuzzy RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach to segment customers in e-commerce.
- Uses fuzzy membership functions to transform RFM scores into degrees, then clusters customers with FCM to obtain soft segments.
- Demonstrates how membership degrees map to marketing actions (e.g., retention, VIP, churn risk).

Key takeaways for FuzzySegment Pro:

- Incorporate fuzzy RFM transforms as a feature engineering option for transactional datasets.
- Provide mapping from fuzzy memberships to marketing playbooks in the UI/technical report.
- Use RFM-based experiments to demonstrate direct business impact (LTV, retention uplift).

Suggested actions:

- Add a notebook showing fuzzy RFM feature construction and clustering results.
- Add mapping templates from segment membership to campaign suggestions in docs.

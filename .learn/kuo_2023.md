Title: Genetic Based Density Peak Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means Algorithms to Cluster Analysis: A Case Study on Customer Segmentation

Publication: Engineering Science and Technology (2023), Vol. 47, Article 101525. DOI: 10.1016/j.jestch.2023.101525

Summary:

- Proposes GA-based optimization for parameter tuning and initialization in fuzzy clustering variants (possibilistic and hybrid approaches).
- Shows improved clustering performance and stability when GA optimizes fuzzifier, cluster count, and initial centers.
- Validates on retail RFM datasets, reporting ARI and NMI as additional validation metrics.

Key takeaways for FuzzySegment Pro:

- Consider genetic or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameters (`m`, number of clusters, initialization seeds).
- Track external validation metrics (ARI, NMI) when ground truth or labeled subsets exist.
- Use stability analysis (multiple runs) and report confidence intervals for evaluation metrics.

Suggested actions:

- Prototype a simple hyperparameter search using `scikit-optimize` or `sklearn.model_selection` and add GA as an advanced option later.
- Add a notebook comparing grid/random/GA search for small datasets.
